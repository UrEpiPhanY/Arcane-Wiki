          No one stands out quite the way Jinx does in Arcane - with her goofy insanity and unpredictable psychosis,
          her scenes are filled with pure chaos.

          <b>She has issues. Obviously. Got a doctor's note.</b>

          <br> <br>
          <b>Powder</b>, aka Jinx, has always been a little different from others - not just in the way of her
          capabilities, but also in her way of dealing with problems and trauma. While Vi channeled her trauma in rash
          actions and mindless fights, Jinx bottled it up in the form of fear, low self-esteem and a deep desire for
          approval from her sister and peers.
        </p>

        <!-- Container for second segment for

          <section id="descCont">
            <p>
              Being the smallest (and the weakest) one in the group, Powder has always been protected by her sister Vi
              and others, often resulting in slowing them down.

              Unlike others, she isn't street smart or an excellent fighter, but she is quite intelligent and a winner
              in her own right. Being the reason for every failure of the group, we see a thirst in Powder - of
              acceptance, love, and acknowledgement.

              <br><br>
              So in a nutshell, this is her childhood before everything goes berserk:
            </p>

            <ul class="description">
              <li><b>Constant exposure to violence</b> even though she is not made for it.</li>
              <li><b>Unhealed trauma</b> of her parents demise</li>
              <li>Being associated as the<b>source of bad luck</b> by her friends - and later her own sister.</li>
              <li>Feelings of <b>incompetence and low self-esteem</b> - and a thirst to prove herself worthy of love and
                acceptance.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <br><br>
              This is who Powder has always been - a child prodigy caught in the wrong place. She was never made for
              violence - yet she was constantly exposed to it.

              Her name is <b>Jinx</b>.
