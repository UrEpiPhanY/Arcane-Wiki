          "We’ve all had bad days. But we learn. And we stick together."
          <br> <br>

          The young, rash, impulsive underdog looking for her rightful place in the world. She has greater goals, a
          regretful past and a strong moral compass. She does what's right and tries to redeem herself whenever she can.

          <b>Isn't she the perfect protagonist from every story ever?</b>

          <br> <br>

          But as a character, Vi had been overshadowed by her strong and insane little sister, Jinx. Jinx's story seems
          too complex and attractive compared to that of Violet, so naturally Vi has been ignored (at least in
          comparison to her siser) by fans and reviewers more or less.

          <br><br>
          <b>But Vi's story isn't straightforwards. Far from it.</b>

          <br><br>
          She comes with her own problems that have been ignored for too long by everyone. Vi never even got a chance to
          deal with the enormity of everything that befell her after her parents' death. Unlike Jinx, who was protected
          by first her sister and then Vander (their father figure), Vi had been thrown into the role of a guardian at
          an age when children play with toys.

          <br> <br>
        </p>

        <!-- Container for second segment for
              continuation of Vi's descriptions -->
        <div class="descContBG">
          <div class="explore">
            <h2>Good Sister, Bad Leader</h2>
          </div>
          <section id="descCont">
            <p>
              Vi's problems get ignored, largely, both by people around her and the audience viewing her story because
              she seems to be dealing well with it - except, of course, by Vander.

              <br><br>
              Vi had been denied a carefree childhood. Responsibilities had been thrust upon her shoulders - that she
              bore without complaints - at an age when perhaps her only biggest problem should have been to worry about
              Christmas presents.

              <br><br>
              So what makes Vi different from your regular neighborhood hero? She isn't tamed into a more docile version
              of herself by the end of the story. But does that mean she has no character arc? Well, not really.

              <br><br>
              Vi has not just been a good sister but <b>the best</b>, given the fact that she herself was a child when
              she became the protector of her younger sibling against everyone. She <b>supports Powder</b> and her
              different talents, protects her from their friend's taunts, and when things get messy, even after years,
              she comes back to the undercity for her sister.

              <br><br>
              Yes, yes - we know she 'left' Powder out on the streets, but that's more on circumstances than on Vi. She
              had been seriously wounded, yet we saw her trying to find her way back to Powder when she saw Silco
              standing there. And this is precisely why she is a bad leader.
